# Custom Web Page Implementation

Welcome to this handcrafted web page project! Built entirely from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and best practices in **Accessibility** and **Responsive Design**, this project is a pixel-perfect implementation of a design by renowned UI/UX designer **Nicolas Philippot**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete front-end build without relying on any external libraries or frameworks. The goal is to replicate the designer's vision with precision while ensuring the page is accessible, responsive, and semantically correct.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure and content

- **CSS3** – Styling, layout, and animations

- **Responsive Design** – Mobile-first approach using media queries

- **Accessibility (a11y)** – ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

## 📐 Design Reference

The layout and visual elements are based on a design file provided by **Nicolas Philippot**. Every detail—from typography to spacing—has been carefully translated into code to match the original design.
